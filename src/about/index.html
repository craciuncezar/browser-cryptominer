      <h1>Fileless browser malware</h1>
      <p>
        The traditional detection methods used by antivirus software are based
        on scanning the hard drive checking against a database of known malware
        signatures. A fileless malware is not affected by those approaches due
        to the fact that it only lives inside the memory and there is no
        indication about its existence on the hard drive. Furthermore the
        malicious code being executed through a legit process such as an
        browser, it can't be flagged as an unknown possible harmful process.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand why the browser is the ideal way to distribute fileless
        malware, let's assume the following scenario: the user opens a web page
        containing a malicious script code, the antivirus checks the JavaScript
        loaded, but because the code is obfuscated dynamically, the malicious
        code cannot be detected during the download phase. Usually the browser
        does not specifically seek permission before running JavaScript, so the
        malicious code is executed, having complete access to the sandboxed web
        browser API which contain a powerful set of technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        These technologies are used by the script to leverage the computational
        power of the victim, providing the attacker the power of each concurrent
        website visitor computer at any given time. Because the malicious code
        is transient and only runs in the background of the browser tab, it is
        difficult to detect the malware once the user has navigated away.
        Therefore, we may ask ourselves, is there something to stop high-traffic
        websites from abusing resources from their users without consent while
        browsing their website?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well the truth is that there is nothing to stop developers or hackers
        exploit the processing power, and even though ethically this seems
        wrong, legally speaking this is still debatable. Oh and if you are
        reading this probably it would be nice from me to let you know that the
        banner below is mining cryptocurrencies for me. Check out your cpu usage
        in task manager.
